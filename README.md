Simulator for karaoke rotation modeling

See index.html for an example of how its used.

Define a singer generator and an "algorithm" and send a bunch of users to sing karaoke. A karaoke show is defined as a bunch of slots (each being a song). 

The entire show is captured in a history object which then can be analyzed for metrics of how the algorithm performed with a given set of inputs (the signups over the span of the show). 

This is just a work in progress.

Unit tests have not been written but the unittests.html is where they can be run.
